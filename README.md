# Project 01: Global Location Online Clock

## Description: 
    The Global Location Online Clock is a website that will display a time and image based on the the users search. while working on this project our group faced many challenges, our main issues stem from the APIs and being able to display the data on our website. 
    We used a image API to retrieve an image of a location that the user searches. We also used a time API to collect the date and time of a location the user searches.   

## User Story: 
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the time and image of any location that I search
SO THAT I can have a glimpse of the location and prepare for any potential time difference.
```

## Acceptance Criteria: 
```
GIVEN an image, date, and time of a location
WHEN I search a location 
THEN I am presented with an image, date, and time of that location
WHEN I want to see my previous searches 
THEN I can see a list of my searches below the search bar
WHEN I want to view my previous searches 
THEN I can click a location on the list below and it will appear i8n the 
search bar
```
